Bose Soundlink II is a Bluetooth portable speaker manufactured and marketed by Bose Corporation. It is known to produce quality sound and was rated one of the best among speakers of its class by PC Magazine and CNET. The speaker belongs to a line of Bluetooth speakers that includes Bose SoundLink and Bose SoundLink III.

The speaker received positive reviews with particular praise devoted to the reproduction of bass and sub-bass. Numerous publications noted that the speaker handles the low end very well for its small size. However, the speaker has been criticized for being expensive and lacking additional functionality such as speakerphone capability.

Reception
The second generation SoundLink received an "Excellent" rating from PC Magazine and retained the Editors' Choice award that was given to its predecessor. PC Magazine noted about the speaker: "Bose products may have their detractors in audiophile circles, but there are many things the company does right, and some the company does brilliantly."[2] CNET gave the speaker an "Excellent" rating and commented: "While the SoundLink Bluetooth Mobile Speaker II may no longer be in a class by itself, it's still near the top of the portable Bluetooth speaker category."[1] Meta review site Engadget showed overall positive rating.[3] Nick Guy of Ilounge rated the speaker at "B-" and, while commenting positively about its industrial design and compactness, mentioned that the speaker is "seriously underpowered for the price versus competitors".[4] Josh Covington, the Editor-in-Chief of Geeky product reviews, gave the speaker 4.25 out of 5 and commented that it produces very good sound quality considering its size yet lacks the speakerphone feature.[5]

Hardware
Bose SoundLink II includes new neodymium transducers, dual-opposing passive radiators and a revised digital signal processing that gives the speaker slightly better sound compared to the original version. It includes a built-in rechargeable battery that powers the speaker for 3 to 4 hours of use at high volume levels and 6–8 hours at moderate volume levels. The unit is charged via a proprietary charger.[1]

Design
Bose SoundLink II looks virtually identical to the original model, with a design that reflects some of the lines of Apple products.[1] Minor changes have been made to the design of the integrated protective cover/stand, which automatically turns the speaker off when closed in what has been called a 'bi-fold' design.[6] On top of the case there is a row of oversized buttons: Power, Multifunctions (mute, previous or next track, play/pause, siri, accept/decline/end call), Bluetooth, Volume - and Volume +; and on the back there is a micro USB port and a 3.5mm jack auxiliary input. The new version can remember up to eight devices for automatic pairing, with a possibility of 2 devices both connected.[2]

Sound
SoundLink II plays incredibly loud for its size without distortion and delivers "rich, clear and detailed sound for all types of music: acoustic guitar, rock and pop, like what you'd get from a larger speaker."[1] It doesn't retain original sound though due to a lot of digital signal processing and therefore may not be suitable for audiophiles that would like to listen to a natural sound. The processing is done to prevent distortion and increase the output, and the resulting sound is nice.[2] The sound quality has improved a bit from a previous version of the speaker. The new model produces kick drum that is slightly punchier "with a short "boom" tail". The speaker has an enhanced upper midrange and a "smoother, airier-sounding high range". Baritone sounded clear and full over acoustic guitar in Bill Callahan's "Drover" during the PC Magazine testing.[2]

Hugo Award for Best Fanzine

Presented by	World Science Fiction Society
First awarded	1955
Most recent winner	Lady Business (Clare, Ira, Jodie, KJ, Renay, and Susan)

Ira and Susan accepting the 2017 Hugo Award for Best Fanzine for Lady Business
The Hugo Awards are given every year by the World Science Fiction Society for the best science fiction or fantasy works and achievements of the previous year. The award is named after Hugo Gernsback, the founder of the pioneering science fiction magazine Amazing Stories, and was once officially known as the Science Fiction Achievement Award.[1] The award has been described as "a fine showcase for speculative fiction" and "the best known literary award for science fiction writing".[2][3] The Hugo Award for Best Fanzine was given each year for non professionally edited magazines, or "fanzines", related to science fiction or fantasy, published in English, and which has published four or more issues with at least one issue appearing in the previous calendar year.[4] Awards were also once given out for professional magazines in the professional magazine category, and since 1984 have been awarded for semi-professional magazines in the semiprozine category; several magazines that were nominated for or won the fanzine category have gone on to be nominated for or win the semiprozine category since it was established.

The award was first presented in 1955, and has been given annually since except for in 1958. A "fanzine" is defined for the award as a magazine that does not meet the Hugo award's criteria for a professional or semi-professional magazine. Specifically, it must meet less than two of the five Hugo criteria for consideration as a semiprozine: that the magazine had an average press run of at least one thousand copies per issue, paid its contributors and/or staff in other than copies of the publication, provided at least half the income of any one person, had at least fifteen percent of its total space occupied by advertising, and announced itself to be a semiprozine.[5] This is the oldest long-running Hugo award for fan activity; in 1967 Hugo Awards were added specifically for fan writing and fan art. In addition to the regular Hugo awards, beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or "Retro Hugos", have been available to be awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years prior in which no awards were given.[6] To date, Retro Hugo awards have been awarded for 1939, 1941, 1946, 1951, and 1954, and the fanzine category has been included each year.[7]

Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon), and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as instant-runoff voting with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The works on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated. The 1955 and 1956 awards did not include any recognition of runner-up magazines, but since 1957 all of the candidates were recorded.[6] Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held.[8] Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations.[9] Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and are held in a different city around the world each year.[1][10]

During the 69 nomination years, including Retro Hugo years, 128 magazines run by 177 editors have been nominated. Of these, 39 magazines run by 67 editors have won, including ties. Locus has won 8 times out of 13 nominations, the most wins of any magazine. Mimosa has won 6 of 14 nominations and File 770 has won 6 of 31, the most nominations of any magazine. Ansible has won 5 out of 11 and Science Fiction Review has won 4 of 12; they are the only other magazines to win more than twice. Challenger has the most nominations without winning at 12; the next highest is FOSFAX with 7. As editor of Locus Charles N. Brown has won 8 of 13 nominations, though he shared 8 of those awards with Dena Brown. Richard E. Geis has won 6 of 15 nominations for his work on Science Fiction Review, Psychotic, and The Alien Critic; Mike Glyer has won 7 of 31 for editing File 770; David Langford has won 5 of 12 for work on Ansible and Twil-Ddu; and Richard Lynch and Nicki Lynch have both won 6 of 14 nominations for Mimosa. Guy H. Lillian III has the most nominations without winning at 12 for Challenger.

History and profile
The weekly magazine was founded in Rome by Oberdan Catone and Vito De Bellis in 1931. It was the first satirical magazine to be started in Italy following the forced closure of other satirical magazines by the Fascist regime, particularly Il Becco Giallo, of which it inheredit many collaborators.[1] It immediately distinguished itself for its original humour, often abstract and surreal.[2][3] Initially polemic and courageous, after several judicial seizures it gradually ignored political themes and focusing in a humour which was an end in itself, eventually getting a large success and selling over 300,000 copies a week.[3][4]

In 1952 it was launched a Ligurian edition of the magazine, directed by Enzo La Rosa. In 1954 the magazine became fortnightly, and shortly later monthly.[3]

In 1955 Marc'Aurelio was acquired by the publisher Corrado Tedeschi who moved the editorial staff in Florence, and the magazine reprised its weekly basis. It eventually ceased its publications in 1958.[5][6]

Many young collaborators of the magazine including Federico Fellini, Steno, Vittorio Metz, Ettore Scola, Cesare Zavattini, Age & Scarpelli, Ruggero Maccari, after the World War II started successful careers in the Italian film industry.[5][7]

In 1973 Delfina Metz (the daughter of Vittorio), with the artistic supervision of Enrico De Seta, shortly relaunched the magazine, which definitely closed the same year after 26 issues.[3][5]
