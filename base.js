Bose Soundlink II is a Bluetooth portable speaker manufactured and marketed by Bose Corporation. It is known to produce quality sound and was rated one of the best among speakers of its class by PC Magazine and CNET. The speaker belongs to a line of Bluetooth speakers that includes Bose SoundLink and Bose SoundLink III.

The speaker received positive reviews with particular praise devoted to the reproduction of bass and sub-bass. Numerous publications noted that the speaker handles the low end very well for its small size. However, the speaker has been criticized for being expensive and lacking additional functionality such as speakerphone capability.

Reception
The second generation SoundLink received an "Excellent" rating from PC Magazine and retained the Editors' Choice award that was given to its predecessor. PC Magazine noted about the speaker: "Bose products may have their detractors in audiophile circles, but there are many things the company does right, and some the company does brilliantly."[2] CNET gave the speaker an "Excellent" rating and commented: "While the SoundLink Bluetooth Mobile Speaker II may no longer be in a class by itself, it's still near the top of the portable Bluetooth speaker category."[1] Meta review site Engadget showed overall positive rating.[3] Nick Guy of Ilounge rated the speaker at "B-" and, while commenting positively about its industrial design and compactness, mentioned that the speaker is "seriously underpowered for the price versus competitors".[4] Josh Covington, the Editor-in-Chief of Geeky product reviews, gave the speaker 4.25 out of 5 and commented that it produces very good sound quality considering its size yet lacks the speakerphone feature.[5]

Hardware
Bose SoundLink II includes new neodymium transducers, dual-opposing passive radiators and a revised digital signal processing that gives the speaker slightly better sound compared to the original version. It includes a built-in rechargeable battery that powers the speaker for 3 to 4 hours of use at high volume levels and 6–8 hours at moderate volume levels. The unit is charged via a proprietary charger.[1]

Design
Bose SoundLink II looks virtually identical to the original model, with a design that reflects some of the lines of Apple products.[1] Minor changes have been made to the design of the integrated protective cover/stand, which automatically turns the speaker off when closed in what has been called a 'bi-fold' design.[6] On top of the case there is a row of oversized buttons: Power, Multifunctions (mute, previous or next track, play/pause, siri, accept/decline/end call), Bluetooth, Volume - and Volume +; and on the back there is a micro USB port and a 3.5mm jack auxiliary input. The new version can remember up to eight devices for automatic pairing, with a possibility of 2 devices both connected.[2]

Sound
SoundLink II plays incredibly loud for its size without distortion and delivers "rich, clear and detailed sound for all types of music: acoustic guitar, rock and pop, like what you'd get from a larger speaker."[1] It doesn't retain original sound though due to a lot of digital signal processing and therefore may not be suitable for audiophiles that would like to listen to a natural sound. The processing is done to prevent distortion and increase the output, and the resulting sound is nice.[2] The sound quality has improved a bit from a previous version of the speaker. The new model produces kick drum that is slightly punchier "with a short "boom" tail". The speaker has an enhanced upper midrange and a "smoother, airier-sounding high range". Baritone sounded clear and full over acoustic guitar in Bill Callahan's "Drover" during the PC Magazine testing.[2]

In 2012 he soon after released the album Both Sides of the Tracks.[2] Rayven Justice released several singles that summer as well. In 2013 he partnered with Rita Lee, CEO of Nuface Entertainment, to form Rayven Justice Music Group, and Signed a non exclusive distribution deal with Empire Distribution.Although a partnership with California based label Urban Life Distribution with aegis of Sony RED was planned , Justice chose EMPIRE Distribution .[3]

2013: "Slide Thru" and collaborations

In late 2013 he released his single "Slide Thru," which featured Migos. It was published through Empire Distribution in San Francisco,[4] and received regular airplay on the Bay Area radio station KMEL.[3] Wrote Complex.com about the song in 2014, "it shows how very slight variations on an existing formula can create radically different effects on the listener, the cartoonish 'I'm Different' pianos mutating into enigmatic atmosphere."[4] A remix of "Slide Thru" by Migos was later released in March 2014.

In January 2014, he release the mixtape I have a dream was released by January 20, 2014

August 2014: I Have a Dream EP and album
He has toured in support of his music, opening KMEL's annual Summer Jam concert held at the Oracle Arena in Oakland.[3] According to Rayven Justice, the Oracle Arena performance held personal significance, as he and his younger brother had previously promised one another never to attend Summer Jam unless they were performing at the event.[5] He was living in the Bay Area as of early 2014, also spending time in Los Angeles to collaborate with rappers and producers[6] such as TeeFlii.,[6][7] and in September he toured throughout much of the United States with Compton rapper Problem .

On August 19, 2014 he released the EP I Have a Dream, with tracks such as "Slide Thru," "I See You" featuring Kool John, and "Hit or Nah."[3] The album was released on his own record label, with the singles distributed through Empire Distribution. He released a second remix of his earlier track "Slide Thru" in October 2014, with a feature by Atlanta rapper Waka Flocka Flame.[8] A music video for their collaboration was released in early November, as was an album-length version of I Have a Dream Deluxe. Rayven Justice is one of several Bay Area artists selected to perform at the first EMPIRE Unplugged live recording session on December 11, 2014, which also included other soul and R&B artists such as Chinx Uncle Murda Joe Moses Eric Bellinger, Jonn Hart, and Lyrica Anderson.[9]

In early 2015, he released a single with aspiring rapper Ankit Oswal "AO" under the label Team3MG. This topped multiple charts on youtube, and desi-hiphop. He is currently working with AO on a second single expected to be released in early 2017.[10]

July 17, 2015 Rayven Justice released The Cassette Playlist Mixtape hosted by Dj Carisma.

Hugo Award for Best Fanzine
Awarded for	The best non-professional magazine devoted primarily to science fiction or fantasy
Presented by	World Science Fiction Society
First awarded	1955
Most recent winner	Lady Business (Clare, Ira, Jodie, KJ, Renay, and Susan)
Website	thehugoawards.org

Ira and Susan accepting the 2017 Hugo Award for Best Fanzine for Lady Business
The Hugo Awards are given every year by the World Science Fiction Society for the best science fiction or fantasy works and achievements of the previous year. The award is named after Hugo Gernsback, the founder of the pioneering science fiction magazine Amazing Stories, and was once officially known as the Science Fiction Achievement Award.[1] The award has been described as "a fine showcase for speculative fiction" and "the best known literary award for science fiction writing".[2][3] The Hugo Award for Best Fanzine was given each year for non professionally edited magazines, or "fanzines", related to science fiction or fantasy, published in English, and which has published four or more issues with at least one issue appearing in the previous calendar year.[4] Awards were also once given out for professional magazines in the professional magazine category, and since 1984 have been awarded for semi-professional magazines in the semiprozine category; several magazines that were nominated for or won the fanzine category have gone on to be nominated for or win the semiprozine category since it was established.

The award was first presented in 1955, and has been given annually since except for in 1958. A "fanzine" is defined for the award as a magazine that does not meet the Hugo award's criteria for a professional or semi-professional magazine. Specifically, it must meet less than two of the five Hugo criteria for consideration as a semiprozine: that the magazine had an average press run of at least one thousand copies per issue, paid its contributors and/or staff in other than copies of the publication, provided at least half the income of any one person, had at least fifteen percent of its total space occupied by advertising, and announced itself to be a semiprozine.[5] This is the oldest long-running Hugo award for fan activity; in 1967 Hugo Awards were added specifically for fan writing and fan art. In addition to the regular Hugo awards, beginning in 1996 Retrospective Hugo Awards, or "Retro Hugos", have been available to be awarded for years 50, 75, or 100 years prior in which no awards were given.[6] To date, Retro Hugo awards have been awarded for 1939, 1941, 1946, 1951, and 1954, and the fanzine category has been included each year.[7]

Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon), and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the World Science Fiction Society Constitution as instant-runoff voting with six nominees, except in the case of a tie. The works on the ballot are the six most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of works that can be nominated. The 1955 and 1956 awards did not include any recognition of runner-up magazines, but since 1957 all of the candidates were recorded.[6] Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held.[8] Prior to 2017, the final ballot was five works; it was changed that year to six, with each initial nominator limited to five nominations.[9] Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and are held in a different city around the world each year.[1][10]

During the 69 nomination years, including Retro Hugo years, 128 magazines run by 177 editors have been nominated. Of these, 39 magazines run by 67 editors have won, including ties. Locus has won 8 times out of 13 nominations, the most wins of any magazine. Mimosa has won 6 of 14 nominations and File 770 has won 6 of 31, the most nominations of any magazine. Ansible has won 5 out of 11 and Science Fiction Review has won 4 of 12; they are the only other magazines to win more than twice. Challenger has the most nominations without winning at 12; the next highest is FOSFAX with 7. As editor of Locus Charles N. Brown has won 8 of 13 nominations, though he shared 8 of those awards with Dena Brown. Richard E. Geis has won 6 of 15 nominations for his work on Science Fiction Review, Psychotic, and The Alien Critic; Mike Glyer has won 7 of 31 for editing File 770; David Langford has won 5 of 12 for work on Ansible and Twil-Ddu; and Richard Lynch and Nicki Lynch have both won 6 of 14 nominations for Mimosa. Guy H. Lillian III has the most nominations without winning at 12 for Challenger.

History and profile
The weekly magazine was founded in Rome by Oberdan Catone and Vito De Bellis in 1931. It was the first satirical magazine to be started in Italy following the forced closure of other satirical magazines by the Fascist regime, particularly Il Becco Giallo, of which it inheredit many collaborators.[1] It immediately distinguished itself for its original humour, often abstract and surreal.[2][3] Initially polemic and courageous, after several judicial seizures it gradually ignored political themes and focusing in a humour which was an end in itself, eventually getting a large success and selling over 300,000 copies a week.[3][4]

In 1952 it was launched a Ligurian edition of the magazine, directed by Enzo La Rosa. In 1954 the magazine became fortnightly, and shortly later monthly.[3]

In 1955 Marc'Aurelio was acquired by the publisher Corrado Tedeschi who moved the editorial staff in Florence, and the magazine reprised its weekly basis. It eventually ceased its publications in 1958.[5][6]

Many young collaborators of the magazine including Federico Fellini, Steno, Vittorio Metz, Ettore Scola, Cesare Zavattini, Age & Scarpelli, Ruggero Maccari, after the World War II started successful careers in the Italian film industry.[5][7]

In 1973 Delfina Metz (the daughter of Vittorio), with the artistic supervision of Enrico De Seta, shortly relaunched the magazine, which definitely closed the same year after 26 issues.[3][5]

In linguistics, grammar (from Greek: γραμματική) is the set of structural rules governing the composition of clauses, phrases, and words in any given natural language. The term refers also to the study of such rules, and this field includes phonology, morphology, and syntax, often complemented by phonetics, semantics, and pragmatics.

Speakers of a language have a set of internalized rules[1] for using that language and these rules constitute that language's grammar. The vast majority of the information in the grammar is — at least in the case of one's native language—acquired not by conscious study or instruction, but by observing other speakers. Much of this work is done during early childhood; learning a language later in life usually involves a greater degree of explicit instruction.[2] Thus, grammar is the cognitive information underlying language use.

The term "grammar" can also be used to describe the rules that govern the linguistic behaviour of a group of speakers. The term "English grammar", therefore, may have several meanings. It may refer to the whole of English grammar, that is, to the grammars of all the speakers of the language, in which case, the term encompasses a great deal of variation.[3] Alternatively, it may refer only to what is common to the grammars of all, or of the vast majority of English speakers (such as subject–verb–object word order in simple declarative sentences). Or it may refer to the rules of a particular, relatively well-defined variety of English (such as standard English for a particular region).

A specific description, study or analysis of such rules may also be referred to as a grammar. A reference book describing the grammar of a language is called a "reference grammar" or simply "a grammar" (see History of English grammars). A fully explicit grammar that exhaustively describes the grammatical constructions of a language is called a descriptive grammar. This kind of linguistic description contrasts with linguistic prescription, an attempt to discourage or suppress some grammatical constructions, while promoting others. For example, preposition stranding occurs widely in Germanic languages and has a long history in English. John Dryden, however, objected to it (without explanation),[4] leading other English speakers to avoid the construction and discourage its use.[5]

Outside linguistics the term grammar is often used in a rather different sense. In some respects, it may be used more broadly, including rules of spelling and punctuation, which linguists would not typically consider to form part of grammar, but rather as a part of orthography, the set of conventions used for writing a language. In other respects, it may be used more narrowly, to refer to prescriptive grammar only and excluding those aspects of a language's grammar that are not subject to variation or debate. Jeremy Butterfield claimed that, for non-linguists, "Grammar is often a generic way of referring to any aspect of English that people object to."[6]

Etymology
The word grammar is derived from Greek γραμματικὴ τέχνη (grammatikē technē), which means "art of letters", from γράμμα (gramma), "letter", itself from γράφειν (graphein), "to draw, to write".[7] The same Greek root also appears in graphics, grapheme, and photograph.

History
Further information: History of linguistics
The Babylonians made some early attempts at language description,[8] but the first systematic grammars, of Sanskrit, originated in Iron Age India, with Yaska (6th century BC), Pāṇini (6-5th century BC[9]) and his commentators Pingala (c. 200 BC), Katyayana, and Patanjali (2nd century BC). Tolkāppiyam, the earliest Tamil grammar, is mostly dated to before the 5th century AD.

In the West, grammar emerged as a discipline in Hellenism from the 3rd century BC forward with authors like Rhyanus and Aristarchus of Samothrace, the oldest extant work being the Art of Grammar (Τέχνη Γραμματική), attributed to Dionysius Thrax (c. 100 BC). Latin grammar developed by following Greek models from the 1st century BC, due to the work of authors such as Orbilius Pupillus, Remmius Palaemon, Marcus Valerius Probus, Verrius Flaccus, and Aemilius Asper.

A grammar of Irish originated in the 7th century with the Auraicept na n-Éces. Arabic grammar emerged with Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali in the 7th century. The first treatises on Hebrew grammar appeared in the High Middle Ages, in the context of Mishnah (exegesis of the Hebrew Bible). The Karaite tradition originated in Abbasid Baghdad. The Diqduq (10th century) is one of the earliest grammatical commentaries on the Hebrew Bible.[10] Ibn Barun in the 12th century compares the Hebrew language with Arabic in the Islamic grammatical tradition.[11]

Belonging to the trivium of the seven liberal arts, grammar was taught as a core discipline throughout the Middle Ages, following the influence of authors from Late Antiquity, such as Priscian. Treatment of vernaculars began gradually during the High Middle Ages, with isolated works such as the First Grammatical Treatise, but became influential only in the Renaissance and Baroque periods. In 1486, Antonio de Nebrija published Las introduciones Latinas contrapuesto el romance al Latin, and the first Spanish grammar, Gramática de la lengua castellana, in 1492. During the 16th-century Italian Renaissance, the Questione della lingua was the discussion on the status and ideal form of the Italian language, initiated by Dante's de vulgari eloquentia (Pietro Bembo, Prose della volgar lingua Venice 1525). The first grammar of Slovene language was written in 1583 by Adam Bohorič.

Grammars of non-European languages began to be compiled for the purposes of evangelization and Bible translation from the 16th century onward, such as Grammatica o Arte de la Lengua General de los Indios de los Reynos del Perú (1560), and a Quechua grammar by Fray Domingo de Santo Tomás.

From the latter part of the 18th century, grammar came to be understood as a subfield of the emerging discipline of modern linguistics. The Deutsche Grammatik of the Jacob Grimm was first published in the 1810s. The Comparative Grammar of Franz Bopp, the starting point of modern comparative linguistics, came out in 1833.

Theoretical frameworks
Further information: Syntax § Theories

Simple constituency grammar parse tree, whereby the sentence is divided into a noun phrase and a verb phrase.
Frameworks of grammar, which attempt to give a precise scientific theory of the syntax rules of grammar and their function, have been developed in theoretical linguistics. Most mainstream frameworks are based on the conception of an innate "universal grammar", an idea developed by Noam Chomsky. The most prominent theories are:

This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.
Generative grammar: algorithmic constituency aka "phrase structure" relation (Noam Chomsky 1950)
Transformational grammar (1960s)
Generalised phrase structure grammar (late 1970s)
Head-driven phrase structure grammar (1985)
Principles and parameters grammar (Government and binding theory) (1980s)
Lexical functional grammar
Categorial grammar (lambda calculus)
Montague grammar
Minimalist program-based grammar (1993)
Dependency grammar: dependency relation (Lucien Tesnière 1959)
Link grammar
Cognitive grammar / Cognitive linguistics
Construction grammar
Fluid Construction Grammar
Word grammar
Stochastic grammar: probabilistic
Operator Grammar
Functional grammar: usage-oriented (behaviorist)
Danish Functionalism
Systemic functional grammar
Role and reference grammar
Parse trees are commonly (but not always) used by such frameworks to depict their rules. There are various additional notation schemes for some grammars:

Constraint grammar
Tree-adjoining grammar
Affix grammar over a finite lattice
Lambda calculus
X-bar theory
Backus–Naur form
Development of grammars
Main articles: Historical linguistics and History of English grammars
Grammars evolve through usage and also due to separations of the human population. With the advent of written representations, formal rules about language usage tend to appear also. Formal grammars are codifications of usage that are developed by repeated documentation over time, and by observation as well. As the rules become established and developed, the prescriptive concept of grammatical correctness can arise. This often creates a discrepancy between contemporary usage and that which has been accepted, over time, as being correct. Linguists tend to view prescriptive grammars as having little justification beyond their authors' aesthetic tastes, although style guides may give useful advice about standard language employment, based on descriptions of usage in contemporary writings of the same language. Linguistic prescriptions also form part of the explanation for variation in speech, particularly variation in the speech of an individual speaker (an explanation, for example, for why some people say "I didn't do nothing", some say "I didn't do anything", and some say one or the other depending on social context).

The formal study of grammar is an important part of education for children from a young age through advanced learning, though the rules taught in schools are not a "grammar" in the sense most linguists use the term, particularly as they are often prescriptive rather than descriptive.

Constructed languages (also called planned languages or conlangs) are more common in the modern day than they used to be, although still extremely uncommon compared to natural languages. Many have been designed to aid human communication (for example, naturalistic Interlingua, schematic Esperanto, and the highly logic-compatible artificial language Lojban). Each of these languages has its own grammar.

Syntax refers to the linguistic structure above the word level (e.g. how sentences are formed)—though without taking into account intonation, which is the domain of phonology. Morphology, by contrast, refers to structure at and below the word level (e.g. how compound words are formed), but above the level of individual sounds, which, like intonation, are in the domain of phonology.[12] No clear line can be drawn, however, between syntax and morphology. Analytic languages use syntax to convey information that is encoded via inflection in synthetic languages. In other words, word order is not significant and morphology is highly significant in a purely synthetic language, whereas morphology is not significant and syntax is highly significant in an analytic language. Chinese and Afrikaans, for example, are highly analytic, and meaning is therefore very context-dependent. (Both do have some inflections, and have had more in the past; thus, they are becoming even less synthetic and more "purely" analytic over time.) Latin, which is highly synthetic, uses affixes and inflections to convey the same information that Chinese does with syntax. Because Latin words are quite (though not completely) self-contained, an intelligible Latin sentence can be made from elements that are placed in a largely arbitrary order. Latin has a complex affixation and simple syntax, while Chinese has the opposite.

Education
Prescriptive grammar is taught in primary and secondary school. The term "grammar school" historically refers to a school teaching Latin grammar to future Roman citizens, orators, and, later, Catholic priests. In its earliest form, "grammar school" referred to a school that taught students to read, scan, interpret, and declaim Greek and Latin poets (including Homer, Virgil, Euripides, Ennius, and others). These should not be confused with the related, albeit distinct, modern British grammar schools.

A standard language is a particular dialect of a language that is promoted above other dialects in writing, education, and broadly speaking in the public sphere; it contrasts with vernacular dialects, which may be the objects of study in descriptive grammar but which are rarely taught prescriptively. The standardized "first language" taught in primary education may be subject to political controversy, because it may sometimes establish a standard defining nationality or ethnicity.

Recently, efforts have begun to update grammar instruction in primary and secondary education. The primary focus has been to prevent the use of outdated prescriptive rules in favour of more accurate descriptive ones and to change perceptions about relative "correctness" of standard forms in comparison to non-standard dialects.

The pre-eminence of Parisian French has reigned largely unchallenged throughout the history of modern French literature. Standard Italian is not based on the speech of the capital, Rome, but on the speech of Florence because of the influence, Florentines had on early Italian literature. Similarly, standard Spanish is not based on the speech of Madrid, but on that of educated speakers from more northerly areas like Castile and León (e.g. see Gramática de la lengua castellana). In Argentina and Uruguay the Spanish standard is based on the local dialects of Buenos Aires and Montevideo (Rioplatense Spanish). Portuguese has, for now, two official standards, respectively Brazilian Portuguese and European Portuguese.

The Serbian language is divided in a similar way; Serbia and the Republika Srpska use their own separate standards. The existence of a third standard is a matter of controversy, some consider Montenegrin as a separate language, and some think it is merely another variety of Serbian.

Norwegian has two standards, Bokmål and Nynorsk, the choice between which is subject to controversy: Each Norwegian municipality can declare one of the two its official language, or it can remain "language neutral". Nynorsk is endorsed by a minority of 27 percent of the municipalities. The main language used in primary schools normally follows the official language of its municipality and is decided by referendum within the local school district. Standard German emerged from the standardized chancellery use of High German in the 16th and 17th centuries. Until about 1800, it was almost entirely a written language, but now it is so widely spoken that most of the former German dialects are nearly extinct.

Standard Chinese has official status as the standard spoken form of the Chinese language in the People's Republic of China (PRC), the Republic of China (ROC) and the Republic of Singapore. Pronunciation of Standard Chinese is based on the local accent of Mandarin Chinese from Luanping, Chengde in Hebei Province near Beijing, while grammar and syntax are based on modern vernacular written Chinese. Modern Standard Arabic is directly based on Classical Arabic, the language of the Qur'an. The Hindustani language has two standards, Hindi and Urdu.

In the United States, the Society for the Promotion of Good Grammar designated 4 March as National Grammar Day in 2008.[13]
